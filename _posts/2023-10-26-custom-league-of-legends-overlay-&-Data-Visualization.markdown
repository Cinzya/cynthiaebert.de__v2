## Problem & Goals

The NACL HUD was originally built in 2017 and was a simple HTML page that was updated via JavaScript. It was not very flexible and was difficult to maintain. The goal of this project was to rebuild the HUD using React and to make it more flexible and easier to maintain.

The first step in the process was to create a design for the HUD. I worked with the client to create a design that would be easy to read and understand while also being visually appealing. The design was created in Figma and was then exported to SVG files.
